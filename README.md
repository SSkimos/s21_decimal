- You can view our tests in tests folder.

### How to build?
 Prerequisites: 
1. check.h library
2. gcc compiler 
3. pkg-config
- `cd src`
- `make`

### What have we learned?
- A lot of float & decimal implementation in IEEE 754 standart.
- Improved our structual programming skills
- Improved Makefile building skills
- Improved unit-testing skills 

### Who made it?
- hotblack@student.21-school.ru: Masha made all arithmetics!
- curtrika@student.21-school.ru: Nikita made conversion funcs and worked on other funcs with me and Masha.
- workerco@student.21-school.ru: I made comparsion and helped Nikita with conversion.
